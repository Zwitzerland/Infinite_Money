# Strategy Ledger

Maintain a backlog of hypotheses with citations and required tests. Update during research cycles.

1. Placeholder hypothesis: Establish baseline mean-reversion equity strategy with turnover controls. (UN-GROUNDED PLACEHOLDER)
   - Expected failure modes: regime shifts, crowding, high borrow costs.
   - Required tests: walk-forward, slippage sensitivity, turnover cap enforcement.
