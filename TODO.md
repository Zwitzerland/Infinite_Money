# TODO

## Iteration 1

- Run `make smoke` locally (requires LEAN CLI + Docker).
- Run `make optimize` locally (>=20 trials).
- Add PDF references to `knowledge/pdfs/` and update `knowledge/refs.yaml`.

## Iteration 2

- Add trial caching + multi-regime evaluation in optimizer.
- Expand LEAN smoke test to a minimal data window for faster runs.
- Wire transformer/RL offline training stubs under `optimizer/`.
