# Event-Driven Conflict Risk (Research-Only)

## Important Constraints
- No illegal or non-public information.
- No "funding both sides" or covert activity guidance.
- No guarantees of zero loss or risk-free profit.

## Research-Grade Framing
Event-driven risk research focuses on *public* information and transparent
market instruments to understand how shocks propagate across asset classes.

### Common, legal instruments
- Defensive/war-risk proxies: defense sector ETFs, commodities, energy, FX safe-havens.
- Risk-off hedges: treasury duration exposure, volatility proxies.
- Event-driven options structures: straddles/strangles for volatility expansion.

### Neutral structures (still risky)
- Relative value spreads across sectors with offsetting exposures.
- Volatility-neutral hedges using delta-hedged options (requires expertise).

## Research Protocol
1) Identify public event timelines and data sources.
2) Build scenario libraries with bounded assumptions.
3) Backtest with regime splits (pre/post event windows).
4) Include realistic slippage, spreads, and execution costs.
5) Apply strict risk caps and stop-loss rules.

## Notes
No strategy offers "perfect hedge" or guaranteed upside. This document is a
research outline, not a trading recommendation.
