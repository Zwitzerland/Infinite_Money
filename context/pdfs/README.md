# Context PDFs

Place grounding PDFs in this directory. Filenames are discovered automatically by the ingestion pipeline. Do not commit proprietary or licensed content without permission.

The ingestion script records SHA256 checksums for reproducibility and extracts per-page text when available. Keep files relatively small for local processing.
